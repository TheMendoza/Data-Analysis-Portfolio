# Jonnel Mendoza - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Interior & Spatial Design from the Chelsea College of Arts. My journey into data analytics is driven by my natural curiosity and passion for uncovering insights through analysis and visualization. I believe that design and storytelling with data aren't too far apart, as both involve crafting compelling narratives and solutions through a blend of creativity and logic.

Healthcare Industry Experience:

Over the past decade, I have built a robust career in the healthcare industry. Here, I have honed my soft skills, particularly in providing excellent customer service and enhancing patient experiences. My technical skills were sharpened through developing clinical KPI dashboards, analyzing patient satisfaction surveys, and producing comprehensive performance reports for management and the board of directors.

Technical Proficiency:

Recently, I completed a 12-week intensive Data Technician Bootcamp with Just IT, where I gained proficiency in Tableau, Power BI, SQL and Python

My unique blend of creative problem-solving, technical proficiency, and a strong passion for data analytics sets me apart. I am eager to leverage these skills to drive insights and innovations.

## Portfolio Projects
  In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the analytical tools used to solve cases.
## Python
  ### Cardiac Triage Questionnaire App
  <p><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong><br>The Cardiac Triage Questionnaire app is designed to streamline the patient intake process by assessing and recording the severity of cardiac symptoms upon arrival or registration. Using a simple Python-based interface, this tool provides a quick and efficient way to prioritize patient care based on their triage scores.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the app is to facilitate effective and timely triage decisions in a healthcare setting. By evaluating patient responses to a series of pre-defined questions, the app calculates a total score that indicates the urgency of the patient's condition.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring and Action</strong><li>Total Score Greater Than 4: The app triggers a triage call to ensure immediate attention for potentially severe conditions.</li><li>Total Score Less Than 4: Patients with lower scores are directed to proceed with standard booking procedures, allowing healthcare providers to  manage their workload effectively.</li></p>

<p>The app can be seamlessly embedded into an HTML website or integrated into existing applications, providing a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals and enhancing patient management efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong><li>Efficiency: Quickly assesses and records patient conditions to aid in prioritizing care.</li><li>Integration: Can be embedded into websites or other applications for easy access and use.</li><li>Scoring System: Provides actionable outcomes based on a calculated score, facilitating prompt and appropriate care responses.</li></p>
  
  ### Insights into Healthcare Costs | Identifying Key Drivers
  <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/TheMendoza/TheMendoza.github.io/blob/main/Insights%20into%20Healthcare%20Costs%20-%20Identifying%20Key%20Drivers4.0.pdf">See Full Overview</a></strong></p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/TheMendoza/TheMendoza.github.io/blob/main/Healthcare_Insurance_Project.ipynb">Code</a></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong><br>To understand the factors that influence medical insurance costs and to develop predictive model for estimating healthcare expenses. My analysis will be focused on both the    descriptive and diagnostic aspect, leveraging individual data to build models that can forecast or estimate future healthcare expenditures, rather than solely describing past trends or prescribing actions.</p>
  <p><strong>Scope</strong><li>Loading and preprocessing the data</li><li>Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</li><li>Visualizations</li><li>Performing correlation analysis</li><li>Summarizing the findings</li>       <li>Deriving actionable insights to guide insurance companies and public health initiatives</li></p>
  <p><strong>Tools Used for this Project</strong><br>Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and PowerPoint</p>

## Tableau
  ### UK Police Force | Street Crimes Dashboard: Monitoring Trends and Hotspots
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/TheMendoza/TheMendoza.github.io/blob/main/UK%20Police%20Force%20Street%20Crime%20Dashboard%20Overview.pdf">See Full Overview</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong><br>Monitoring trends and identifying hotspots in street crime in the UK</p>
<p><strong>Questions it should answer:</strong> What are the trends in street crime over the specified period? Where are the hotspots of street crime located?</p>
<p><strong>Decisions it should inform:</strong> Deployment of police resources, adjustment of crime prevention strategies, and allocation of investigative efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Tools Used for this Project</strong><br>Tableau, Excel, Power BI, and Python</p>

## Microsoft Access | Database Design
  ### Database Design | Cardiac Clinic Healthcare Management System
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/TheMendoza/TheMendoza.github.io/blob/main/MicrosoftAccess-HealthcareManagementSystem-CardiacClinic.pdf">See Full Overview</a></strong></p>  
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong><br>Create a database for a Cardiac Clinic to help them set up a Healthcare Management System using Microsoft Access, which includes various tables and forms to manage patient data, appointments, diagnostics, and medical records efficiently. The database aims to manage and streamline the Cardiac Clinic's operations, including tracking patient information, scheduling appointments, storing diagnostic imaging results, maintaining medical records, and managing care pathways.</p>
<p><strong>Tools Used for this Project</strong><br>Microsoft Access</p>
