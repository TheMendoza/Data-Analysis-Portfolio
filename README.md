# Jonnel Mendoza - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Interior & Spatial Design from the Chelsea College of Arts. My journey into data analytics is driven by my natural curiosity and passion for uncovering insights through analysis and visualization. I believe that design and storytelling with data aren't too far apart, as both involve crafting compelling narratives and solutions through a blend of creativity and logic.

Healthcare Industry Experience:

Over the past decade, I have built a robust career in the healthcare industry. Here, I have honed my soft skills, particularly in providing excellent customer service and enhancing patient experiences. My technical skills were sharpened through developing clinical KPI dashboards, analyzing patient satisfaction surveys, and producing comprehensive performance reports for management and the board of directors.

Technical Proficiency:

Recently, I completed a 12-week intensive Data Technician Bootcamp with Just IT, where I gained proficiency in Tableau, Power BI, SQL and Python

My unique blend of creative problem-solving, technical proficiency, and a strong passion for data analytics sets me apart. I am eager to leverage these skills to drive insights and innovations.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
  In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the analytical tools used to solve cases.

  ### Insights into Healthcare Costs | Identifying Key Drivers
  <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/TheMendoza/TheMendoza.github.io/blob/main/Insights%20into%20Healthcare%20Costs%20-%20Identifying%20Key%20Drivers4.0.pdf">See Full Overview</a></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong><br>To understand the factors that influence medical insurance costs and to develop predictive model for estimating healthcare expenses. My analysis will be focused on both the    descriptive and diagnostic aspect, leveraging individual data to build models that can forecast or estimate future healthcare expenditures, rather than solely describing past trends or prescribing actions.</p>
  <p><strong>Scope</strong><li>Loading and preprocessing the data</li><li>Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</li><li>Visualizations</li><li>Performing correlation analysis</li><li>Summarizing the findings</li>       <li>Deriving actionable insights to guide insurance companies and public health initiatives</li></p>
  <p><strong>Tools Used for this Project</strong><br>Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and PowerPoint</p>
